# Project Instructions & Architecture

This document contains the general rules and architectural overview for the T3 Chat Cloneathon project.

## 0. Package Manager

**CRITICAL:** This project uses **pnpm ONLY**. Never use npm or yarn.

-   **Installation:** Use `pnpm install` to install dependencies
-   **Running scripts:** Use `pnpm run dev`, `pnpm run build`, etc.
-   **Adding packages:** Use `pnpm add <package-name>`
-   **Dev dependencies:** Use `pnpm add -D <package-name>`
-   **Lockfile:** Only `pnpm-lock.yaml` should exist (never `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`)

If you encounter npm lockfiles, remove them immediately:
```bash
rm package-lock.json yarn.lock
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install
```

## 1. Core Architecture Principles

This project uses a specific, decoupled architecture. Adhere to these roles strictly:

-   **Next.js (App Router):** Handles **ALL** frontend UI and **ALL** backend logic via **Server Actions**. We **DO NOT** use Next.js API Routes.
-   **Convex:** Used **ONLY** as the real-time database. All data reads and writes go through Convex queries and mutations.
-   **Clerk:** Used **ONLY** for user authentication (Google Sign-In).
-   **Vercel AI SDK:** The glue for the chat interface. It connects the frontend `useChat` hook directly to our Next.js Server Action.
-   **OpenRouter:** The LLM provider, accessed from the Server Action.

## 2. Authentication Flow (Clerk -> Convex)

This is a critical security rule. The flow is:

1.  Clerk authenticates the user on the client-side.
2.  The Convex backend is configured to trust JWTs from Clerk via its JWKS endpoint URL.
3.  All authenticated calls to Convex from the client are automatically validated by Convex, which securely identifies the user.

## 3. Backend Logic (Server Actions ONLY)

All server-side logic for the chat happens in a Next.js Server Action located in `app/actions.ts`.

-   The frontend `useChat` hook calls this Server Action directly.
-   The Server Action uses the Vercel AI SDK's `streamText` function to call the OpenRouter API.
-   The action streams the response directly back to the client.

## 4. Data Persistence Flow

Saving messages to the Convex database is a strict two-step process:

1.  **User Prompt:** When the user submits the form, **immediately** call the `saveMessage` Convex mutation to save the user's prompt.
2.  **AI Response:** After the AI stream is complete, use the `onFinish` callback from the `useChat` hook to call the `saveMessage` mutation **again** to save the AI's full response.

## 5. Key File Locations

-   **Master Plan:** `implementation.md`
-   **Server Logic:** `app/actions.ts`
-   **Database Schema:** `convex/schema.ts`
-   **Database Functions:** `convex/messages.ts`
-   **Main UI Component:** `src/components/ChatUI.tsx`

## 6. Learning System Protocol

**IMPORTANT:** Only add learning lessons to README.md when the user explicitly requests it with commands like:
- "I want to learn about [concept]"
- "Save this concept for later review"
- "Add this to learning lessons"
- "Help me understand [concept]"

**Never automatically add lessons.** Wait for explicit user instruction.

When adding lessons to README.md:
1. Add under the "📚 Learning Lessons" section
2. Use the lesson template format
3. **CRITICAL:** Use only targeted, specific resources - never general documentation links
4. Focus on the exact concept the user wants to learn
5. Resources must be specific tutorials, guides, or targeted documentation pages
